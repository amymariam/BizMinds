# BizMinds — AI-Powered Business Insights Assistant

BizMinds is an AI-driven analytics assistant that helps you **interact with your business data** using natural language.  
Ask any question about your company’s sales, revenue, or product performance, and BizMinds will generate insightful, data-backed answers.

## Overview

BizMinds combines the power of:
- **🧠 LlamaIndex** — to intelligently query your CSV datasets like a database  
- **🤖 Anthropic Claude 3** — for generating human-like, analytical insights  
- **🎨 Streamlit** — for a simple, beautiful, and interactive web UI  

If LlamaIndex isn’t available (e.g., version or import issue), the app **automatically falls back** to using the Claude API directly — so you’ll never be stuck.
